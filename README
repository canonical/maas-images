This builds maas ephemeral images from daily builds of cloud images.
Ie, it creates stuff that goes on
  http://maas.ubuntu.com/images/ephemeral-v2/daily
from stuff on
  http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/daily

== setup ==
  Run './system-setup' to set up the system.
  This will install necessary dependencies.

== building images ==
To run:
  PYTHONPATH=$PWD PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH ./bin/meph2-cloudimg-sync out.d

  You can then add filters to the end, like 'release=trusty' or
  'arch=amd64'.  The resultant out.d/streams/v1/ will have information
  copied from maas.ubuntu.com for all other products, but will only
  create new content for products that match the provided filters.


To debug and use the fake 'maas-cloudimg2eph2', run like:
  env MAAS_CLOUDIMG2EPH2=fake-maas-cloudimg2eph2 \
     PYTHONPATH=$PWD PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH ./bin/meph2-cloudimg-sync out.d

  This will still download di-kernels and di-initramfs.
