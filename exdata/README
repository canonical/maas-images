each directory under here is a disjoint source/site.
 * muc/ (maas.ubuntu.com)
 * hcc/ (hyperscale.canonica.com)

files in those directories are products.
they contain the same basic layout as a product_id in a content_id.

The intent is to build a tool that can do this:

 * mk-exdata --output=muc-output/ --content-id=maas.ubuntu.com:boot \
     muc/precise-*
   this would create a index.json in muc-output with valid stream.
   it would just create the files and insert checksums and sizes.

   Other parameters would be '--as-of-date=20140213' to only produce
   output as of that date, and '--max=3' to limit the output to only
   the latest 3 in each entry.

   mk-exdata would fill in the paths per the '_path'.
