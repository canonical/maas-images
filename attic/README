This contains the code that the old process would use.

The old process:
  lp:~smoser/maas/maas.ubuntu.com.images-ephemeral
     this code would build the images and produce 'query' output
     like in https://maas.ubuntu.com/images/query/
 
  maas_oxygen.sh then runs to create the simplestreams data.

maas_oxygen and the programs it rusn were copied from some priate repos.
