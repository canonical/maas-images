# Patch can be used to modify metadata. The patch command will use the
# value assoicated with the label of the stream. Lets say Ubuntu 20.10
# becomes an LTS release. By using a regular expression you can easily
# patch all 20.10 products.
#
# Note: The dates are quoted otherwise yaml.safe_load returns them as
# a Date object.
