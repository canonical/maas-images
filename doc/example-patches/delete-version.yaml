# Deleting a version can be done by defining the product and version without
# a label matching the stream. The patch command supports Python regular
# expressions so you don't have to define each product individually. The
# patch below removes 20200721 from all 20.04 products. Because versions
# aren't being added this patch may be used without defining a source.
#
# Note: Patch only modifies the stream metadata when deleting. To cleanup
# left over finds use the find-orphans and reap-orphans commands.
